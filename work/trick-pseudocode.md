# Definitions

- `deck`: `Deck`, initially containing an equal number of black and red `card` references. 
- `blackPile`: `List` of `Card`, initially empty.
- `redPile`: `List` of `Card`, initially empty.
- `random(n)`: `Integer`, selected at random, with equal likelihood, from {0, 1, ..., (n-1)}.

# Steps

1. Shuffle `deck` using the `random` function as a source of randomness.
2. Repeat until `deck` is empty:
    1. `selector`: `Card` &larr; next `card` dealt from `deck`.
    2. If color of `selector` is black:
        - Add next `card` drawn from `deck` to `blackPile`.        
        Otherwise:   
        - Add next `Card` drawn from `deck` to `redPile`.
3. Verify that the count of black `Card` values in `blackPile` = count of red `Card` values in `redPile`.
